# 🧠 Online Examination System – OIBSIP Java Development Task 2

## 📌 Objective  
This project is a **console-based Online Examination System** built using **Java**.  
It allows users to log in, update their profile, answer multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and automatically submit their exam when the timer expires.

## ⚙️ Features Implemented  
- 🔑 **Login System** – User authentication using username and password  
- 📝 **Update Profile & Password** – Modify credentials anytime after login  
- ❓ **MCQ Selection** – User can choose answers from multiple questions  
- ⏱️ **Timer & Auto-Submit** – Automatic submission after a fixed duration (simulated)  
- 🔒 **Logout System** – Secure session termination after exam completion  

## 🧩 Concepts Used  
- **Abstract Class** (`User`)  
- **Interface** (`ExamActions`)  
- **Polymorphism** – `User` reference pointing to `OnlineUser` object  
- **Final, Default, and Static Methods**

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Language:** Java (JDK 8+)  
**IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA  
**Core Concepts:** OOP | Abstraction | Interfaces | Polymorphism  
▶️ How It Works  
1. The user logs in with a username and password.  
2. After login, the user can update their credentials.  
3. The system displays MCQs for the exam.  
4. Once answers are selected, the system auto-submits after a short simulated timer.  
5. The session ends with a logout message.  
**🎯 Outcome**
This project demonstrates the application of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts — abstraction, inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism — in a practical Java application that simulates a real-life online examination system.
