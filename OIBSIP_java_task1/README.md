# 🏦 ATM Interface – OIBSIP Java Development Task 1

## 📌 Objective  
This project is a **console-based ATM Interface** built using **Java**.  
It allows users to perform essential banking operations such as checking transaction history, withdrawing, depositing, and transferring funds securely.

## ⚙️ Features Implemented  
- 🔑 **User Authentication** – User ID and PIN verification  
- 📜 **Transaction History** – Displays all previous transactions  
- 💸 **Withdraw** – Secure withdrawal from the user’s account  
- 💰 **Deposit** – Add funds to the account balance  
- 🔄 **Transfer** – Transfer money to another user account  
- ❌ **Quit** – Exit the ATM system safely
  
## 🧩 Concepts Used  
- **Classes & Objects**    
- **Encapsulation and OOP Concepts**  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Language:** Java (JDK 8+)  
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA
- **Core Concepts:** Object-Oriented Programming, Interface

## ▶️ How It Works  
1. The system prompts the user for a **User ID** and **PIN**.  
2. After successful authentication, the main menu is displayed.  
3. The user can perform **Withdraw, Deposit, Transfer,** or view **Transaction History**.  
4. Once done, the user can **Quit** the system safely.  

## 🎯 Outcome  
This project demonstrates the use of **core Java OOP principles** and exception handling in a simple yet practical **ATM system simulation**, enabling users to perform basic banking operations.
